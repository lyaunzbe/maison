##Spotify##

I spend a huge majority of my time listening to music, as it is usually playing around in the background, be it in my room from the speakers or in my earbuds when I'm on the go. I used to use iTunes to manage my music, both on the computer and on my mp3 player, but have now completely switched over to Spotify and can access my collection from the cloud. Part of the reason I am now a Spotify user and am willing to pay a subscription fee is the amazing UI/UX of both the mobile and desktop apps. They have truly created an interface that makes searching and playing any song, artist, or album a ubiquitous process across devices. The mobile interface in particular excels in usability, as it gives you access to many features, even ones you would think would be restricted to the desktop, but at the same time it does so with minimal complexity and great design. This is a result of high visibility through taking advantage of intuitive icons and concise, but essential, labeling. The app, both on mobile and desktop, allows for an amazing range of customizability for not that much effort. Creating playslists from multiple albums or other playlists is a really fluid, as well as creating radio stations from those playlists, or based on some other factor (artist, genre, etc). The flow of searching and discovering new music, especially on the mobile interface, is really efficient and something I can do as I am walking to class.

I also think that the info panel is cleverly designed, overlaying the track view and maximizing configuration options over such a small space. All in all, I am a satisfied customer of good interface design and look forward to continuing to use Spotify.

##Foursquare##

I am also a huge fan of the Foursquare mobile application and use it all the time when I can't think of where to eat. Honestly, I dont really even use the app for its intended purpose (checking-in and browsing the geo feed of others). However, the search and recommendation functionality is so flawlessly executed on the iPhone that it far surpasses its competition, like Yelp.

Just like the Spotify iPhone app, Foursquare uses every inch of screen real estate to its advantage. In particular, take a look at the search results for the explore tab. The map at the top is fantastic, as it takes into account those people who are primarily constrained by locations. Yet, the results themselves are great because they convey so much information in so little space (distance, price, the top review). I am usually able to make a decision without even having to actually select a search result. In general, the app maintains it's own defined consistency and standards throughout the interface for certain actions like checking in, pinning locations, but otherwise, it sticks to natural mappings that most users will already be familiar with. One can also appreciate the aesthetics and typography of this app, as they serve to not only make the interface cleaner, but more organized and easy to manage.

##Facebook##

Facebook wasn't always as bad as I feel it is has become. There were
many reasons I abandoned MySpace, but primarily it was for the leaner
and cleaner UI that Facebook sported. Now, the interface of Facebook, although
still aesthetically pleasing with it's flat design, is way too
cluttered. There are numerous features, options and configurations that
are just buried in various nooks and crannies across the home page and
the rest of the fifteen settings pages. I will admit, however, that the
core functionality of Facebook, which entails commenting, status updates
and post pictures, is a pleasent user experience and feels natural to
use. Ask someone to like a post and they will have no issue, but ask
that same person to change the privacy restrictions on their photos and
suddenly you have a clear case of information overload that will certainly spiral 
into taught helplessnes. Furthermore, some dialogs and setting menus
only appear when hovered over some area. These kinds of intentions are not made 
clear via design and don't achieve the primary focus of helping the user accomplish their 
goals through the interface. Editing your groups or changing your
profile picture is a specific example of this failure.

##myNEU##

The myNEU web interface, which is the main control hub from where
students manage their account and classes, is a perfect example of
failed UI/UX design. Right off the bat, the myNEU portal is riddled with
backend (server) that cause frequent session timeouts, requiring you to
log back in numerous times. If your login is incorrect and you go
backwards in your browser's history to retry the login form, this 
won't work. You actually have to follow a sperate link to get back to 
this form and have it properly work. Aside from the technical issues,
which really should be fixed as soon as possible, the interface is mired
with numerous poor design decisions. Their is a lack of flow and
cohesion between different sections. Also, the organization and name of
the various sections isn't very intuitive at all. A new user would probably 
have to take the time to look through each section so they could
understand what goes where and why. Probably the most heinous offense
would be the unnecessary use of popups where a page would suffice. Oh
and say you are browsing your current schedule but also want to look at
the next semester's course registration. When you click the link
intended for registration, it will automatically replace the class
schedule popup with a popup of its own. For an interface that offers so
much essential and important functionality, myNEU does nothing to
streamline the process whatsoever.
