##(1) Gamified Gym##

This would be ideal as a mobile app. The inspiration of the interface
comes from Duolingo. Check into your local gym, compete with your
friends in leaderboard for various machines and exercises around the
gym. You can see your friend's gym 'streams' and they can see yours.
Things like badges and achievements can be added for even more
gamification.

##(2) Bus Reservation App##

I find it odd that we have things like Kayak, Hipmunk, and
FlightFox for air travel, but not for bus travel. It would be trivial to
scrape other major bus sites, like Mega Bus, Bolt, Greyhound, etc, so
that people can go to one location to find and compare prices for bus
tickets.

##(3) Gestural Window Tiling Manager##

Ever since using the AWM and XMonad window managers on linux, I have
been looking for something that is as customizable/programmable on other
operating systems. However, even the most basic window tiling
functionality is huge for my productivity. It would be interesting to
develop a window manager that uses the webcam to detect gestures,
allowing you to swipe your windows left, right, top, bottom. Pinch to
minimize and unpinch to maximize. Their is a lot of stuff to explore for
this idea. In terms of technical limitations, I think it would be more
reasonable to create this as a web application that manages widgets, rather 
then an actual OS utility.
