##Usability##

The first three articles discuss usability, providing the general definition, application and rules. Usability is based around the ideas of user-centered design, meaning that a truly usable interface feels natural to the user, is easy to learn, and supports the user's needs/goals. Ultimately, the utility (or functionality) and usability of an interface  can determine the usefulness of a website. This is especially true of sites involved in e-commerce or selling products, where the consumer's purchasing decision often comes down to the ease of use and the navigation of the site.

The five primary factors of usability, as offered by the Neilsen Norman group, are as follows: 

  * Learnability: Can users learn the interface quickly and start using
  it effectively?

  * Efficiency: How quick/productive is the interface?

  * Memorability: After not using the interface for a while, how long
  will it take for a user to readjust?

  * Errors: What kinds of errors do users make and how are they handled?

  * Satisfaction: How pleasing is the actual interface to use?

An important skill to gain is to be able to accurately gauge the usability of an application/interface so that we can improve it if possible. This is done primarily through user expereince research with the demographic of users that your application/interface intends to target. Ideally, usability should be constantly considered throughout the iterative design process so that the users needs are properly met.

I enjoyed reading these articles as a generalized overview of what usability is. As a web developer myself, I definately have come to learn through experience that usability is the primary factor that drives reoccuring users. It would be interesting, continuining in a similar vein, to discuss the role of accessibility and how it affects usability. On one hand, targeting as broad of an audience as possible is always good for exposure. Yet, it somestimes occurs that a UX change for accesibility purposes makes an interface more complicated and less intuitive as a whole. 

##Captcha##

CAPTCHA is a system of security designed to tell computers apart from humans. This is beneficial to prevent the spamming of forms, stopping bots in their tracks and denying DDoS attacks. The way it does this is by providing an image with distorted text, something that a human can easily parse, but is much more difficult for a computer to discern.

Honestly, I feel as though CAPTCHAs are outdated as a method of security. I have heard of certain implementations being cracked and it is also clear that CAPTCHAs are not accessible by design. However, reCAPTCHA is a good example of using this security system to advance the digitization of text through crowdsourcing. It would be interesting to think of some improvements or possible replacements for the CAPTCHA system.
