#Numero Uno#

Aloha folks! Welcome to my corner on the nets. Just as a quick
introduction, I'm Ben Lyaunzon, a New York studying CS and Interactive
Media in Boston. I like code, art, and everything x, where {x : x ∈ code ∩ art}.

I've never really kept up a blog/journal, digital or otherwise, so this
will be quite an experiment. Hopefully not a short one :)

I expect there will be some musings, rants, and lots of posts about
current things I'm working on, solutions I encounter, etc. Possibly 
some sketches, songs, little notes. Who knows, but I guess that's 
the exciting part. Until next time, I leave you with some music. Chicha 
is a corn-based liquor popular in South America, but also a style of music 
popular in Peru during the 70's. Awesome!
