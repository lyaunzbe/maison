#Readings Week 1#

##[Introduction to HCI](http://old.sigchi.org/cdg/cdg2.html)##

This first reading comes from ACM's special interest group on Human Computer Interaction. The specific chapter in question first provides us with a generalized definition of HCI. The array of topics and areas that involve HCI is potentially limitless and not clearly defined at the moment, as our notions of interaction, humans, and machines are constantly evolving at an ever increasing pace. HCI draws from many disciplines and topics within computer science, linguistics, and even cognitive psychology. A brief historical perspective is then given of HCI as a field. As computing became popularized and commercialized, sales of personal computers & devices became directly tied to the quality of their interfaces [1]. Future developments of HCI are tied to things like the decreasing cost of hardware, integration of computation into everyday objects and tools, portability, and more [2]. Some future trends of HCI to expect include, but are not limited to, the proliferation of group interfaces (think Google Hangouts), embedded computation (fridges that connect to the internet),and even application UIs that transform based on who is using them. The next and final section outlines what can be thought of as the five main, interrelated aspects of HCI. Together they provide a framework for conceptual and practical understanding of HCI.

I enjoyed this text because it approaches HCI at a foundational level and doesn't assume prior experience. Yet, the text was verbose and the language itself was academic in nature, making this a very dry read. Another complaint was is that the content seems a bit outdated. Some of future developments that are described have either already occurred or have even been surpassed by curent tech. It would be interesting, as a class, to discuss our own predictions of where HCI and UX/UI design will go in the next few years.

##[User Centered Design](http://www.stcsig.org/usability/topics/articles/ucd%20_Web_devel.html)##

This article, originally published in the Usability Interface newsletter, discusses what UCD is as a philosophy, but also goes into the core concepts that make it a process. It then goes into a deeper look at how to actually develop web sites through the process of user-centered design. UCD primarily is a design strategy centered around the user, where we develop and design around the user's needs, tasks, and goals. Furthermore, through UCD, we should be able to cut costs by making users satisfied and increasing their productivity. It achieves this through focusing on the aspects of usefulness and usability. Usefulness is something that is simply determined by how well the logic of an action or a program correlates to its design and if it matches what the user is looking for. Usability is hugely important as well, as it drives productivity and satisfaction. Things like visibility, accessibility, and navigation, should all be taken into account when designing and developing for the web. Developing UCD web sites and applications is primarily all about interaction and feedback from users. Since they are the center of your design process, keeping this feedback constantly in loop is ideal to iterate and improve upon your product. [3]

I thought this article was much more interesting then the first reading. It was far more clear and concise. I, myself, personally agree with this style of design and think that it is very similar to a software production practice known as "Lean". They both value the user feedback loop as the main guide for development. I think it would be interesting to discuss this concept of Lean manufacturing in class. It takes the UCD philosophy/process and applies it outside the web.



##[The Kinect](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/diy/top-10-robotic-kinect-hacks)

The Kinect is a very interesting piece of hardware, both from a technical standpoint and as a cultural shift. The device itself is impressive and was developed by an Israeli company called PrimeSense. It acts as a 3D sensor and provides applications in computer vision. The fact that the Kinect even exists for the consumer market and at such a low price shows that there is a technological shift occurring where the cost of hardware is decreasing rapidly and providing a lower barrier to entry into working and hacking on hardware. This has already happened to software with things like OSS, Github, and cloud hosting (Heroku), but is also now happening on the hardware side with things like the Kinect, Arduino toolkit, and the Raspberry Pi processor. 

I found these videos and the article quite interesting, but, to be honest, have already seen most of the mods shown. I think the future for hardware is very bright. I myself have tinkered with several robotics libraries on the javascript node platform ([johnny-five](https://github.com/rwldrn/johnny-five)). It would be interesting to learn more about Arduino and explore HCI in that context, as it is very low level in comparison to something like UI for web applications.

###Additional Questions###

Q1) What is HCI? What is User Centered Design? What is the difference between the two?

A1) HCI stands for Human Computer interaction. It involves the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for use by humans. It also observes and studies the psychology of humans in the context of computing and technology. User centered design is a philosophy and a design/production process that is centered around the user. It strives for ultimate usability and usefulness to cut costs, increase productivity, and improve overall user satisfaction. I think that the main difference is that while HCI is a broad description of a field and discipline involving human interaction with computers, UCD is more of a guideline for creating design that is interactive and focused on the user. In that sense, UCD is a part (subset) of HCI.

Q2) What other uses have you seen for Kinect? The example videos you saw were fantastical or fun, but what practical applications can you think of for the Kinect? Why would this applications be useful or novel, and what practical issues could it address?

A2) I've seen some pretty cool kinect hacks, such as 3D Scanners, different types of tracking/visualization and even an interactive "dressing-room", which allows you to try on virtual clothes. Honestly, as fun as these hacks are, I am really excited to see how the Kinect develops into a user interface tool for automation and improved workflow. A lot of artistic, architectural and CAD programs could benefit from using the Kinect as a gesture based controller for programs like Photoshop, Inventor, AutoCAD etc. Even things like micro/nano surgery may eventually be possible through the Kinect.
