    Hello! My name is Benjamin Lyaunzon. I am a student currently enrolled at Northeastern University in Boston where I am studying Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>    
    My goal is to push the boundaries of the frontend web, through form and function. Particularly, I enjoy making graphically compelling representations
    of data, visual storytelling on the web and building intelligent, interactive user expereinces.
    </p>
    <p>    
    I also really like art, films, racquet sports and running.
